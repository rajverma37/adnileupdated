how to update website codee

git add . ( it will prepare all new files)
git commit -m "new margin" ( what we change)
git push


* error while push file code mistmatch then two ways to fix  
1. pull from github repo before push 
2. use ( git push -u origin main --force ) to push all new code from pc to github ( it can loose data or code , if something added on github but not in pc folder )
